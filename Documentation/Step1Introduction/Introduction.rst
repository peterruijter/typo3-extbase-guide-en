Introduction
==========

TYPO3 programming with piBase is getting more and more complicated and unstructured. There is no clear strategy for programming. So that TYPO3 developers started to search for a new System for TYPO3. There are a lot of frameworks but everyone with own deficites. The desicision was clear, we need an own framework. This was the beginning of FLOW3.

TYPO3 Phoenix is based on FLOW3, now called TYPO3 Flow. Flow with it´s completely new technical basis is not compatible with actual TYPO3 v4. To enable compatibility for Extensions with Flow there is a backport for Flow as extensions extbase and fluid. Extensions based on extbase are compatible with TYPO3 v4.3 and later. With little changes they can be ported to TYPO3 phoenix projects.
